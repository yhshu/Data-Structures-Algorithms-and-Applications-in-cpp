THE ABSTRACT DATA TYPE
.LP
.sp
A \fIstack\fR is an ordered list
of elements.  One end of this list is designated the \fIbottom\fR
and the other is called the \fItop\fR.  A stack with four elements
is shown in ?F{stack}(a). New elements are always added at the top of the
stack.  Suppose we wish to add the element \*(LQE\*(ZQ to the stack
of ?F{stack}(a).  This element will have to be placed on top
of the element \*(LQD\*(ZQ giving us the configuration of
?F{stack}(b).  Deletions from a stack also take place from
the top only.  Hence if we are to delete an element from the stack
of ?F{stack}(b), it will be the element \*(LQE\*(ZQ.  Following
the deletion, the configuration of ?F{stack}(a)
results.  If three successive deletions are performed
on the stack of ?F{stack}(b), the stack of ?F{stack}(c)
results.

FORMULA-BASED REPRESENTATION
.LP
.sp
Since a stack is a linear list with the restriction that additions
and deletions take place at the same end, we may use the linear list
representation of Section 2.3.  The top element of the stack
is stored in @element[length^-^1]@ and the bottom element
in @element[0]@.
The class \fIStack\fR defined in ?P{stackclass} is a derived
class of @LinearList@ (Program 2.1).
The functions \fIAdd\fR and \fIDelete\fR have been implemented by overloading
the binary operators `+' and `-', respectively. The expression @s~+~x@
will add element @x@ to the top of stack @s@ while the expression
@s~-~x@ will delete the top element from the stack @s@ and return the
deleted element in variable @x@.  Both functions return `0' if they are
unable to perform the operation and `1' if the operation is actually performed.

.uh "Efficiency Of @Stack@"
.br
The complexity of each of the stack operations is seen to be
\(*H(1).  Notice that
by deriving @Stack@ from @LinearList@, we have reduced the effort needed
to code the class @Stack@.  Also, we have significantly improved our chances
of obtaining a correct implementation as the methods for @LinearList@
have already been tested and are known to be correct.  Unfortunately, this
simplification has come at the cost of increased run time.  For example,
to add an element to a stack, we first determine its @Length()@ and
then invoke @Insert@ which checks if the insert is in range.  Following
this, a \fBfor\fR loop overhead is paid to perform zero element moves.
We can eliminate these overheads by tailoring the code to the
class @Stack@.  This can be done by either starting afresh or by
accessing the protected members of @LinearList@ to customize our
codes.
.pp
Another potential difficulty is that the derived class @Stack@ is subject
to all of the limitations of the class @LinearList@.  For instance,
the operations \fBcout\fR and `==' need to be defined
on members of the data type @type@ as these are used by the @LinearList@
class members @Print@ and @Search@.
.uh "A Customized Definition of @Stack@"
.br
?P{custom} gives the class definition for @Stack@ when we customize
the @LinearList@ codes.  In a run time test which involved a \fBfor\fR
with 100,000 stack add and delete operations, the code of
?P{stackclass} took 42% more time than did the customized code
of ?P{custom}.  This improvement in performance has however also
come at some cost.

.ft R

.KE
Since the code of ?P{custom} accesses the non-public
members of the class @LinearList@ it is prone to failure when changes are
made to @LinearList@ as these changes are required only to
preserve the integrity of the public members.  This problem can be
overcome by extending the class @LinearList@ (Program 2.1)
to include public members to add and delete at/from the
right end of the list.
Another problem is that the code of
?P{custom} is somewhat more involved than that of ?P{stackclass}.
So,
it is expected to take longer to debug.
.pp
This illustrates some of the
tradeoffs involved between software reuse and program efficiency.
Interestingly, if we develop the code for the class @Stack@ afresh
(i.e., @Stack@ is not derived from @LinearList@ as in ?P{custom}),
and perform the run time experiment described above, the new code runs
13% faster than the customized code of ?P{custom}! 
With improvement in compiler technology, one may expect this difference in

While the array representation of a stack considered in the previous
section is both elegant and efficient, it is wasteful
of space when multiple stacks are to co-exist.  The reasons are the same as
those cited in Chapter 2 for the inefficiency of the separate arrays
for separate lists
representation.  An exception is
when only two stacks are to co-exist.  Now, space and time efficiency can be
maintained
by pegging the bottom of one stack at position 0
and the bottom of the other at position @MaxSize - 1@.  The two stacks
grow towards the middle of the array (see ?F{twostacks}).  When more than
two stacks are to be represented,
the multiple lists in a single array representation may be adapted
to the case of multiple stacks.  While this results in a
space efficient implementation,
the worst case add time becomes
\*(OH(@ArraySize@) rather than \(*H(1).  The delete time remains \(*H(1).

Multiple stacks can be represented efficiently using a chain for each
stack.
This representation incurs a space penalty of one pointer field for each
stack element.  However, each stack operation can be performed in
\(*H(1) time.
When using a chain to represent a stack, we must decide which end
of the chain corresponds to the stack top.  If we associate the right
end of the chain with the stack top, then stack additions
and deletions are implemented using the
chain operations @Insert(n, x)@
and @Delete(n,x)@ where @n@ is the number of nodes in
the chain.  Each of these chain operations takes \(*H(@n@) time.
On the other hand, if we associate the left end of the chain with
the stack top, then the chain operations to use are
@Insert(0, x)@ and @Delete(1,x)@.  Each of these takes \(*H(1)
time.  As a result of this, the left end of the chain represents the
stack top.  The resulting class definition of a linked stack
is given in ?P{lstackclass}.

The implementation of @IsFull@ is inelegant as the only way to know
whether or not we can add an element to a stack is to see if enough
space exists to create a node of type @Node@.  This is done by
invoking \fBnew\fR and then deleting the created node as we do not
intend to use it.
As in the case of the class @Stack@ (?P{stackclass}), we can improve the
run time performance by customizing the code.  The customized code

Parenthesis Matching

In this problem, we are to match the left and right parentheses in a
character string.  For example, the string (a*(b+c)+d) has left parentheses
at positions one and four and right parentheses at positions eight and eleven.
The left parenthesis at position one matches the right at position eleven
while the left parenthesis at four matches the right parenthesis at eight.
In the string (a+b))(, the right parenthesis at six has no matching
left parenthesis and the left parenthesis at seven has no matching
right parenthesis.  Our objective is to write a C++ program that inputs
a string and outputs the pairs of matched parentheses as well as those
parentheses for which there is no match.
.pp
We observe that if we scan the input string left-to-right then each right
parenthesis is matched to the most recently seen unmatched left parenthesis.
This motivates us to save the position of
left parentheses on a stack as they are encountered
in a left-to-right scan.  When a right parenthesis is encountered,
it is matched to the left parenthesis (if any) at the top of the stack.
The matched left parenthesis is deleted from the stack.  The complete C++
program is given in ?P{paren}.  A sample input / output dialogue is given
in ?F{paren}.  The time complexity of ?P{paren} is \(*H(@n@), where
@n@ is the length of the input string.

The \*(LQTowers of Hanoi\*(ZQ problem
is fashioned after the ancient Tower of Brahma
ritual.  According to legend, at the time the world was created there
was a diamond tower (tower 1) with sixty four golden disks.  The disks were
of decreasing size and were stacked on the tower in decreasing
order of size bottom to top.
Besides this tower there are two other diamond towers (towers 2 and 3).
Since the time of creation,
Brahman priests have been attempting to move the disks from
tower 1 to tower 2 using tower 3 for intermediate storage.
As the disks are very heavy, they can be moved only one at a time.
In addition, at no time can a disk be on top of a smaller disk.
According to legend, the world will come to an end when the
priests have completed their task.

In the \fITowers of Hanoi\fR problem\fR, we are given @n@ disks and three
towers.  The disks are initially stacked on tower 1 in decreasing
order of size bottom-to-top.  They are to be moved to tower 2, one disk
at-a-time such that no disk is ever on top of a smaller one.
You may wish to attempt a solution to this problem for
@n@ = 2, 3, and 4 before reading further.
.pp
A very elegant solution results from the use of recursion.
To get the largest disk to the bottom
of tower 2, we move the remaining @n^-^1@ disks to tower 3 and then move
the largest
to tower 2.  Now, we are left with the task of moving the 
@n^-^1@ disks from tower 3 to
tower 2.  To do this we have available the towers 1 and 2.  The fact that
tower 2 has a disk on it can be ignored as this disk is larger
that the disks being moved from tower 3 and so any disk can
be placed on top of it.
Recursive C++ code for this solution is provided in ?P{hanoi}.
The initial invocation is @TowersOfHanoi(n,1,2,3)@.
The correctness of ?P{hanoi} is easily established.

.pp
Let @t(n)@ be the time taken by ?P{hanoi}.  We see that
@t(n)@ is proportional to the number of lines of output
generated.  This is equal to the number of disk moves performed.
Examining ?P{hanoi}, we obtain the following recurrence
for the number of moves, @moves(n)@:
.sp
@moves(n)~=~ left { ~~lpile {0 above {2moves(n-1)~+~1}} ~~~lpile {n=0 above n>0}@
.sp
This recurrence may be solved using the substitution method of
Chapter 1.  The result is @moves(n)@ = @2 sup n ~-~1@.  One can show that
this is, in fact, the least number of moves in which the disks can be moved. 
Since @n@ = 60 in the Tower of Brahma,
it will take the Brahman priests quite a few years to finish their task.
From the solution to the above recurrence, we also obtain @t(n)@ =
\(*H(@2 sup n@).
.pp
While the output from ?P{hanoi} is enough for us to manually move the
disks, it isn't adequate if we wish to animate the move sequence
on a computer display.  Another deficiency is that it doesn't explicitly
specify the label of the disk that is to be moved.  So, if we make an error in
following the move sequence output by ?P{hanoi}, this error may not be detected till several moves later.  To rectify these deficiencies, we may store the state
of the three towers in memory.  This state information is easily displayed
on a computer screen for animation purposes and is also useful to output the
label of the disk being moved.
.pp
Since disks are removed from each tower in a last in first out manner,
each tower may be represented as a stack.  The three towers together contain
exactly @n@ disks at any time.  So, using linked stacks,
we can get by with space for @n@ elements.  If formula-based stacks are used,
towers 1 and 2 must have a capacity of @n@ disks each
while tower 3 must have a capacity of @n^-^1@.
So, space for a total of @3n^-^1@ disks is needed.
As our earlier analysis has shown, the complexity of the Towers of Hanoi
problem is exponential in @n@.  So, using a reasonable
amount of computer time, the problem can be solved only for
small values of @n@ (say @n@ \(<= 30).  For these small values of @n@,
the difference in space required by the formula-based and
linked representations is sufficiently small that either may be used.
.pp
The code of ?P{hanoi2} uses formula-based stacks.
@TowersOfHanoi(n)@ is just a preprocessor for the recursive function
@Hanoi::TowersOfHanoi@ which is modeled after the function of
?P{hanoi}.  The preprocessor creates the three stacks @S[1^:^3]@
that will store the states of the three towers.
The disks are
numbered 1 (smallest) through @n@ (largest).
As a result, each stack is of type \fBint\fR.
The preprocessor returns 0 in case enough space is not
available to create these three stacks.
When enough space is available, it invokes @Hanoi::TowersOfHanoi@
and returns 1 after the necessary moves have been successfully output.

Rearranging Railroard Cars
.LP
.sp
A freight train has @n@ railroard cars.  Each is to be
left at a different station.  Assume that the @n@ stations are numbered
1 through @n@ and that the freight train visits these in the
order @n@ through 1.   The railroad cars are labeled by their
destination.  To facilitate removal of the railroad cars from the
train it is necessary to reorder the cars so that they are
in the order 1 through @n@ front-to-back.  When the cars are
in this order, the last car is detached at each station.
The rearrangement of cars is done at a shunting yard which is
comprised of an \fIinput track\fR, an \fIoutput track\fR, and
@k@ holding tracks that lie between the input and output tracks.
?F{shunt}(a) shows a shunting yard with @k@ = 3 holding
tracks @H1@, @H2@, and @H3@.
The @n@ cars of the freight train begin in the input track
and are to end up in the output track in the order 1 through @n@
right-to-left.
In ?F{shunt}(a), we have @n@ = 9 and the cars are initially in the
order 5, 8, 1, 7, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3 back-to-front.  ?F{shunt}(b)
shows the cars rearranged in the desired order.

.pp
To rearrange the cars, we examine the cars on the input track
front-to-back.  If the car being examined is the next
one in the output arrangement, it is moved directly to the
output track.  If not, it is moved to a holding track and left there
until it is time to place it in the output.
The holding tracks operate in a LIFO manner as cars enter and leave
these from the top of the track.
When rearranging cars, the following moves are permitted:
.US
.np
A car may be moved from the front (i.e., right end)
of the input track to the top
of one of the holding tracks or to the left end of the output track.
.np
A car may be moved from the top of a holding track to the left end of the output track.
.US
.pp
\fIAll other moves are forbidden\fR.
Consider the input arrangement of ?F{shunt}(a).  Car 3 is at the front.
This cannot be output yet as it is to be preceded by cars 1 and 2.
So, it is detached and moved to the holding track @H1@.
The next car, car 6, is also to be moved to a holding track.
If it is moved to @H1@, the rearrangement
cannot be completed as car 3 will be below car 6.  However,
car 3 is to be output before car 6 and so must leave @H1@ before car 6
does.
So, car 6 is put into @H2@.
The next car, car 9 is put into @H3@ as putting it into either @H1@
or @H2@ will make it impossible to complete the rearrangement.
\fINotice that whenever the car labels in a holding track are not
in increasing order top-to-bottom, the rearrangement cannot be completed\fR.
The current state of the holding tracks is shown in ?F{tracks}(a).

Car 2 is considered next.  While it can be moved into any of the holding tracks
while satisfying the requirement that car labels in any holding track be
in increasing order, moving it to @H1@ is preferred.  If it is moved to
@H3@, then we have no place to move cars 7 and 8.  If we move it to @H2@,
then the next car, car 4, will have to be moved to @H3@ and we will have
no place for cars 5, 7, and 8.  \fIThe least restrictions on future
car placement arises when the new car @u@ is moved to the holding track
which has at its top a car with smallest label @v@ such that @v@ > @u@\fR.
We shall use this \fIassignment rule\fR to select the holding track.
.pp
When car 4 is considered, the cars at the top of the three holding tracks
are 2, 6, and 9.  Using our assignment rule, car 4 is moved to @H2@.
Car 7 is then moved to @H3@.
?F{tracks}(b) shows the current state of the holding tracks.
The next car, car 1, is moved to the output track.
It is now time to move car 2 from @H1@ to the output track.
Next, car 3 is moved from @H1@ and then car 4 moved from @H2@.
No other cars can be moved to the output at this time.
.pp
The next input car, car 8, is moved to @H1@.  Then car 5 is moved from
the input track to the output track.  Following this, car 6 is moved from @H2@.
Then car 7 is moved from @H3@, car 8 from @H1@, and car 9 from @H3@.
.pp
While three holding tracks are sufficient to rearrange the cars from
the initial ordering of ?P{shunt}(a), more tracks are needed for other
initial arrangements.  For example, the initial arrangement
1, @n@, @n^-^1@, @...@, 2 requires @n^-^1@ holding tracks.
.pp
To implement the above rearrangement scheme, we use @k@ linked stacks
to represent the @k@ holding tracks.  Linked stacks are used rather than
formula-based ones as by doing so, the space required is that
for only @n^-^1@ elements.
Function @Railroard@ (?P{rail1}) outputs a sequence of move that
results in rearranging @n@ cars with initial ordering @p[1^:^n]@.
It attempts to do this using at most @k@ holding tracks.  In case it fails
for lack of tracks, it returns 0.  If failure is due to lack of memory,
it returns @-@1.  On success, it returns 1.

Function @Railroad@ begins by initializing the linked stack array @H@.
@H[i]@ represents holding track @i@, @1~<=~i~<=~k@.  @NowOut@ is the label
of the car that is to go to the output track next; @minH@ is the smallest
label in any of the holding tracks, and @minS@ is the holding track
(or stack) that contains the car with label @minH@.
The \fBfor\fR loop maintains the invariant \fIat the start of this loop,
the car with label @NowOut@ is not in a holding track\fR.
.pp
In iteration @i@ of the \fBfor\fR loop, car @p[i]@ is moved from the
input track.  This car is to move to the output track
only if @p[i]@ equals @NowOut@.  If car @p[i]@ is moved to the output track,
@NowOut@ increases by one and it may be possible to move one or more of
the cars in the holding tracks out.  This is done in the \fBwhile\fR
loop.
If car @p[i]@ cannot be moved to the output, then no car can be so moved.
Consequently, @p[i]@ is added to a holding track using the stated
track assignment rule.
.pp
The functions @Output@ and @Hold@ utilized by @Railroad@ are given
in Programs ?p{rail.o} and ?p{rail.h} respectively.
@Output@ outputs instructions to move a car from a holding track
to the output track.  It also updates @minH@ and @minS@.
The function @Hold@ puts car @c@ into a holding track using the track
assignment rule.  It also outputs instructions to move the car
to the chosen holding track and updates @minH@ and @minS@
if necessary.
