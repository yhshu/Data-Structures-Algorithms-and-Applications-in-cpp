Matrix b is
rows = 4 columns = 5
nonzero terms = 5
a(1,2) = 1
a(1,3) = 3
a(3,1) = 4
a(3,2) = 3
a(3,4) = -5
The transpose of a is
rows = 5 columns = 4
nonzero terms = 6
a(1,3) = 4
a(2,4) = 1
a(3,1) = 2
a(4,3) = 5
a(5,2) = 3
a(5,4) = 2
The sum of a and b is
rows = 4 columns = 5
nonzero terms = 7
a(1,2) = 1
a(1,3) = 5
a(2,5) = 3
a(3,1) = 8
a(3,2) = 3
a(4,2) = 1
a(4,5) = 2
