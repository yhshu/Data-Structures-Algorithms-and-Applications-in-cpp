Number of Vertices = 4
Number of Edges = 0

The graph is
Number of Vertices = 4
Number of Edges = 4
4 4   2 3   3 2   
1 3   4 1   
1 2   
1 4   2 1   


The graph after deleting (2,1) is
Number of Vertices = 4
Number of Edges = 3
4 4   3 2   
4 1   
1 2   
1 4   2 1   

existsEdge(3,1) = 1
existsEdge(1,3) = 1
inDegree(3) = 1
outDegree(1) = 2
Number of Vertices = 4
Number of Edges = 3
